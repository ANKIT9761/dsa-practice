## This Repo is made for Practising `DSA` 
---
**First Step :**

<p>You have to choose your prefered programming language to do problem solving like Java, C++, Python, Javascript, etc.</p>

### How do you choose between C++ / Java / Python ?

**C++**

>C++ programs are directly compiled into machine-executable codes which consumes less time to execute the code. Hence, it is widely used in competitive programming where you are expected to optimise time and memory. So, if you are interested to explore competitive programming then it is good to start with C++ language

**Java**

>Java programs are easy to understand, structured and less prone to errors. Also, they are platform independent and portable which makes it a good choice for mobile, web and desktop applications. So, if you are looking for a career in software development then it is good to start with the Java language

**Python**

>Python programs are simple in syntax with extensive library support which helps the programmers to come up with required logic with few lines of code. It is popular and widely used in the data domains like data science, Machine learning, deep learning etc.., So, if you are looking for a career in the field of Artificial Intelligence then it is good to start with the Python language

## you will get daily practice problem's solution here and for every topic to practice your DSA like
- SEARCH
- STACK
- QUEUE
- LINKED LIST
- HASH TABLE
- TREE TRAVERSAL
- BINARY TREE
- SORTING
- GREEDY ALGORITHMDYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

~ AND MANY MORE 

### Even you can submit your solution here.


- Try to submit solutions in the language folders -> your_name.
- If there is no folder of your programming language choice you can create one.
